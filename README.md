# coplay

Synchronizing video play between two peers.

## Intro

When two browsers are playing the same web video, coplay can connect them with WebRTC (using PeerJS) and enable users to control two video players synchronously.

Coplay now works on Youku, Sohu TV, Tencent Video, Tudou, iQiyi, YouTube and bilibili.

## Usage

After establishing the connection, both users can perform pause/resume/seek/restart/sync actions.

## FAQ

* Why Peer ID doesn't show up on Youtube?

  Youtube uses HTTPS but PeerJS (the WebRTC service which coplay rely on) will make some HTTP requests, which are blocked by browsers' security policies. Current work around see [here](http://du.screenstepslive.com/s/docs/m/7107/l/219447-allow-mixed-content-in-browsers).

## One More Thing

We need an appropriate **icon** for coplay!
